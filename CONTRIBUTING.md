Know of a place near IBM HQ that visitors must, must go to?
Share and add it to this guide!

Either:

1. File an [issue](https://github.com/adambkaplan/ultimate-ibm-hq-guide/issues/new) with your recommendation.
2. Fork this repo, then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/adambkaplan/ultimate-ibm-hq-guide/compare).

Good recommendations should:

1. Obey the ground rules of the category.
2. Have the name of the establishment.
3. Have a link to their website or online presence (Yelp, Facebook page, etc.).
4. Indicate the location - town name is acceptable, bonus points for having a link to the address on Mapbox/Google Maps.
